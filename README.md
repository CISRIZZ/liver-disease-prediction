2022 IT hackathon project 


# CISRIZZ-LIVER-DISEASE-PREDICTION
This is a program made using kaggle and is A code to help the indian healthcare industry predict kidney liver diseases and save the future of our bharat!




## ðŸ”Ž Making The Project

We used numpy, madplotlib, pandas, seaborn, linear regression from scikit-learn which added up to a machine learning model that precisely predicted the cases with a 72% accuracy. The dataset was researched and provided by a foreign university which was publicly available on Kaggle.


## Our code
```
import numpy as np   #Importing necessary libraries to begin the code with seaborn for connecting pandas and the dataset for plt and warnings are ignored hor a hassle-free coding session!
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```
